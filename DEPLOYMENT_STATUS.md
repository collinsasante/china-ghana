## ⚠️ Current Issue: Cloudflare Webhook Delay

**Problem:** Cloudflare Pages is deploying old commit `92e9b6f` instead of latest commit `cc6712f`

**Root Cause:** Cloudflare Pages webhook experiencing delay or cache issue

**Evidence:**
- Build logs from 2025-11-27T02:54:36 show: "HEAD is now at 92e9b6f"
- Build logs from 2025-11-27T08:25:40 show: "HEAD is now at 92e9b6f"
- GitHub remote verified to have all latest commits including `cc6712f`

**Status:** This is NOT a code issue - all code is correct and ready for deployment

---

## 🔧 Required Action

### Manual Deployment Retry

Since Cloudflare Pages auto-deploy webhook is not picking up the latest commits, you need to **manually trigger a deployment**:

#### Option 1: Retry Failed Deployment
1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Find the failed deployment
4. Click **"Retry deployment"**

#### Option 2: Create New Deployment
1. Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Builds & deployments**
4. Click **"Create deployment"**
5. Select branch: **main**
6. Click **"Save and Deploy"**

#### Option 3: Force Webhook Trigger (Alternative)
```bash
# Make a trivial commit to force webhook
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Cloudflare deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 📋 Environment Variables Checklist

Verify these are set in Cloudflare Pages dashboard under **Settings → Environment Variables**:

### Required for Production:
- [ ] `VITE_AIRTABLE_API_KEY`
- [ ] `VITE_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`
- [ ] `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- [ ] `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`
- [ ] `VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`

### Required for Preview:
- [ ] Same variables as Production (copy all)

**Note:** After adding/updating environment variables, you must redeploy for changes to take effect.

## 🎯 Expected Result After Manual Deployment

Once you manually trigger the deployment and Cloudflare builds the latest commit (`cc6712f`):

1. ✅ Build will succeed (all TypeScript errors fixed)
2. ✅ Application will be live at `https://your-project.pages.dev`
3. ✅ All features will be functional:
   - Customer portal (tracking, invoices, support)
   - China team dashboard (receiving, packaging)
   - Ghana team dashboard (sorting, tagging)
   - Airtable integration
   - Cloudinary image uploads

---

## 📊 Build Verification

After deployment completes, verify:

1. **Build logs show correct commit:**
   ```
   HEAD is now at cc6712f Update deployment status - build successful
   ```

2. **Build succeeds without errors:**
   ```
   ✓ built in XX seconds
   ```

3. **Application loads in browser:**
   - Visit your Cloudflare Pages URL
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Test login functionality
   - Verify Airtable data loads
